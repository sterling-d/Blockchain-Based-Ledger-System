## Usage

To use the quantitative analysis application, simply clone the repository and create a new_folder to save your **pychain.py** . Navigate to that folder within your terminal, and type the following :

```new_folder
   code .  
```

Upon launching the blockchain ledger, you will be able to add multiple blocks within the blockchain, and view their hashes.
